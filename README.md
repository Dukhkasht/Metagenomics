## Diversity analysis
Most common type of analysis which is performed in metagenomics used to find the relative species richness and abundance of microbes in a sample or between two or more samples by performing alpha and beta diversity analysis.
I did these analysis on gut microbiome data and can be viewed [here](Gut%20microbiome%20analysis/diversity%20analysis.R)
